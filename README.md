# This-Little-Light-Of-Mine
Online asymmetrical competitive game in which evil spirits chase around explorers as they try to light a series of bonfires.

This project is built using the Unity3D engine and is currently playable here:

The goal of the game is to either complete objectives as an explorer, or kill the explorers while defending objectives as a nightmare.  It is best played 2v5, but 1v3 is not a bad experience.  Many features are incomplete or missing altogether, but the game is currently playable and pretty fun if I can brag a bit.
